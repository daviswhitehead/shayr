Shayr makes it easy to discover, and give recommendations for, great content within your network of close friends.

Content is always more meaningful when it comes recommended to us from someone we care about. However, finding time to engage with and actually following up on content recommendations is difficult as they are easily lost amongst our digital clutter. Shayr helps you manage content recommendations of any type from all of your friends. Shayr remembers the list of recommendations you’ve been meaning to check out and makes it easy to let your friends know when you’ve finished with something they recommended. On the flip side, after you’ve made a recommendation, Shayr gives you insight into whether your friend plans to check it out and the peace of mind of knowing that when they do, you’ll hear about it.

Shayr’s goal is to create more meaningful interactions between you and your friends by increasing the likelihood that each of you follows through on content recommendations. More meaningful interactions mean deeper friendships and a happier you.
