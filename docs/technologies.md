### Description
The frontend UI and UX of shayr are built using React Native. The main benefit is more or less one codebase for two platforms iOS and Android, and potentially Web in the future.

### Installation
Follow Building Projects with Native Code section on the [Getting Started](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) page.

You need to setup your development environment for both iOS and Android.

### Learning
##### Tutorials
Facebook has their [Learn the Basics](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tutorial) tutorial aimed at complete beginners. After that, I'd recommend [React Native Express](http://www.reactnativeexpress.com/). If you can do the Todo List exercise, you're ready to start contributing to shayr.
##### Resources
I've found it really helpful to start by searching google for what you want to do or implement. Learning about existing solutions at a high level. Then searching for those solutions on github for real world examples.
Also, [Awesome React Native](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/).
