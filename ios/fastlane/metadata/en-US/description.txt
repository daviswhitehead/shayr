Use Cases
- Just listened to this awesome Startup podcast episode and I want to share it with my friends. I especially want John to listen to it and want to know what he thinks of it.
- I'm about to go on vacation and am going to download a book before my flight but need a recommendation.
- I'm always getting good recommendations from my friends for stuff to watch and read, I want an easy place to keep track of them and find new ones to add.
- There are some amazing This American Life episodes but a lot of mediocre ones I don't want to sit through. I want a good way of finding out which are the good ones.
